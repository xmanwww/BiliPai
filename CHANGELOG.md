# Changelog

## [5.3.2] - 2026-02-13

### 🛠 Improvements & Fixes (优化与修复)

- **Top/Bottom Label Alignment Rework**:
  - reduced top-tab selected-state scaling in `图标+文字` mode to remove visual drop/misalignment
  - normalized top-tab icon/text metrics (icon size, line-height, spacing) for consistent optical center
  - adjusted bottom-bar icon+text metrics and baseline to improve icon/title alignment consistency
- **Version Bump**: Updated app version to `5.3.2` (`versionCode` `68`).

## [5.3.1] - 2026-02-13

### ✨ New Features (新增功能)

- **Bangumi Policy Layer**: Added dedicated policy modules to split view logic from screens/viewmodels:
  - `BangumiFollowStatusPolicy`
  - `BangumiModePolicy`
  - `BangumiPlaybackUrlPolicy`
  - `BangumiSeasonActionPolicy`
  - `BangumiUiPolicy`
  - `MyFollowPolicy`
  - `MyFollowStats`
  - `MyFollowStatsDetailPolicy`
  - `MyFollowWatchInsightPolicy`
- **Home Top Category Policy**: Added `HomeTopCategoryPolicy` to centralize top-tab category order/mapping.
- **Mine Drawer Visual Policy**: Added `MineSideDrawerVisualPolicy` for blur/opacity/scrim tuning in one place.
- **Danmaku Settings Policy**: Added `DanmakuSettingsPolicy` for opacity normalization and boundary handling.
- **Watch Later External Playlist Policy**: Added `WatchLaterPlaybackPolicy` to build external queue and start index from clicked item.
- **Top Tab Label Mode Setting**: Added configurable top-tab label mode (`图标+文字 / 仅图标 / 仅文字`) in settings and wired to home header.
- **Playlist Persistence**: Added `PlaylistManager` state persistence/restore (playlist, index, play mode, external-queue flag) and app-start initialization.

### 🛠 Improvements & Fixes (优化与修复)

- **Top Tab Refraction Behavior**: Top indicator now disables refraction when fully stationary; refraction only applies during drag/settle motion.
- **Top Tab Text Clarity**: Removed double-text crossfade rendering that caused ghosting/blur on selected tabs; switched to single-layer color interpolation.
- **Top Tab Icon+Text Layout Polish**: Improved visual placement by changing icon+text style to a cleaner horizontal arrangement.
- **Watch Later Playback Order**:
  - card click now also sets external playlist (not only top-right "play all")
  - queue starts from the clicked item index
  - playback flow no longer falls back to recommended queue unexpectedly in this scenario
- **Search Repository Reliability**: Improved video search fallback path (`all/v2`) and page-info handling/logging.
- **Danmaku Repository Robustness**:
  - refined segment-count fallback policy
  - strengthened thumb-up state resolution and error message mapping
  - improved segment cache safety behavior
- **Eye Protection Logic Cleanup**: Consolidated eye-care decision/tuning/reminder logic into policy helpers for predictable behavior.
- **Bangumi Experience Refinement**:
  - clearer follow-state preload flow
  - safer season-id resolution for action routes
  - cleaner playback-url collection and UI sizing rules
  - improved MyFollow type/stat/watch-insight derivation

### 🛠 Improvements & Fixes (优化与修复)

  - integrated dislike penalties (video / creator / keyword)
